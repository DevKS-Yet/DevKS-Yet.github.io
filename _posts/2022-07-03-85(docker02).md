### Reason

Reason I posted this is while I was trying to build home-server, I got confused within using docker or not.  
When I searched about `docker`, most people talked about kubernetes.  
This is reason why I post about `Kubernetes`. And if it contains wrong info, please leave comments.

### What is Kubernetes?

Previous when it doesn't have Kubernetes, programmers usually put `app`s on an `Operating System`.  
Then when it comes to `Virtualized Deployment`, they put `app` in the `virtual machine` which is on the `Hypervisor`.  
After using `Kubernetes`, `Hypervisor` become `Container Runtime` and `Virtual Machine` become `Container` which only contains `app` and `bin/library`.
